# Automatic-download-of-Sentinel-2-images-, unzip, select bands and create Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
In this  learn how to leverage the EODAG library to connect securely to the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, search for imagery, filter the results to find only those with the lowest cloud cover, and then execute a script that downloads the single best, cleanest image to the folder.
The script unpacks the compressed Sentinel-2 file to  raw image folder. Then searches the complex folder structure to isolate specific Red and NIR bands, copying them into a organized directory. A standard mathematical formula for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, calculates the difference between red and Near Infrared (NIR) to measure plant health. Finally, a high-contrast map is generated and plotted where green identifies healthy vegetation and red shows bare ground.
